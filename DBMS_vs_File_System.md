## DBMS vs. File System


### Structure

**File System:-** It helps to store a collection of raw files of data into a hard disk of the computer

**DBMS:-**  It is a software system which helps to store, manipulate or recover data. 

### Meaning

**File System:-** In this system, the user has to write the procedures for managing the database.

**DBMS:-** In DBMS, the user is not required to write the procedures.

### Where to use	

**File System:-** File system approach used in large systems which interrelate many files.

**DBMS:-** Database approach used in large systems which interrelate many files.	 



### Data Redundancy
**File System:-** In the file system, Redundant data can be present.

**DBMS:-** In DBMS there is no redundant data.

### Backup and Recovery
**File System:-** It doesnâ€™t provide backup and recovery of data if lost.

**DBMS:-** It provides backup and recovery of data even if it is lost.

### Query processing
**File System:-** There is no efficient query processing in the file system.

**DBMS:-** Efficient query processing is there in DBMS.
### Consistency
**File System:-** There is less data consistency in the file system.

**DBMS:-** There is more data consistency because of the process of normalization.
### Complexity
**File System:-** It is less complex as compared to DBMS.

**DBMS:-** It has more complexity in handling as compared to the file system.
### Security Constraints
**File System:-** File systems provide less security in comparison to DBMS.

**DBMS:-** DBMS has more security mechanisms as compared to file systems.
### Cost
**File System:-** It is less expensive than DBMS.

**DBMS:-** It has a comparatively higher cost than a file system.
### Data Independence
**File System:-** There is no data independence.

**DBMS:-** In DBMS data independence exists.
### User Access
**File System:-** Only one user can access data at a time.

**DBMS:-** Multiple users can access data at a time.
### Sharing 
**File System:-** Data is distributed in many files. So, not easy to share data

**DBMS:-** Due to its centralized nature sharing is easy
### Data Abstraction
**File System:-** It gives details of storage and representation of data

**DBMS:-** It hides the internal details of Database
### Integrity Constraints
**File System:-** Integrity Constraints are difficult to implement

**DBMS:-** Integrity constraints are easy to implement
### Example
**File System:-** Cobol, C++

**DBMS:-** Oracle, SQL Server
